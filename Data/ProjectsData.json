We worked with unity collab and after he stopped paying for that, I put the project on GitHub. I also made some updates to the application. A made a christmas update and a sticker pack for iMessages and a update where you can where hats. I did those updates on my own. I really enjoyed working on this project.",

It was a great tip from him and I started making Tic Tac Toe. I want to release the app so it had to have a cool feature. A 4x4 board and a 5x5 board. I spend too much time on this feature and when it was done, I came to a conclusion that it was not fun to play on a 4x4 board and a 5x5 board because who begins wins. :( This was painful to see and I learned something very important: PLAY TEST!, I could've just grabbed a piece of paper and test with a friend if this concept was fun to play. I did learn more about programming and writing elegant code.",

I think that is because I had too little knowledge about UIkit and programming in general. My dad put the app on the app store with his appstore connect account. It was really fun to make it and I learned ALLOT from it. I am happy that my brother forced me to use git and now the project is on github. :) I still want to make the version with swiftUI, but I haven't got the time to do so.",
