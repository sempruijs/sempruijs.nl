        "Content": "Music Share Hub (I know it's not the best name) is a little project that I made for sharing music. I found myself repeating an action over and over. It was thinking about: \"On which platform does person x listen music?\" Was it on spotify? or on youtube? So I made a website where you can type the name of a song in a text-field, and the links would generate automatically. The input was stored in the url so you could send that to your friends. And when your friend opens the url, they can decide for them self. It was pretty easy to make, but I did learn a few small things. Storing information in a url and styling a text-field. I was very happy that I could program, because I could solve a problem that I had with my programming skills",

I really enjoyed seeing my app on the Apple tv because the screen is so much bigger than a phone. I didn't spent to much time on it because it was not a \"new\" concept but I did finish it to the end which felt very rewarding.",

I wanted to learn more about JavaScript so I learned how to load a .json file and creating html elements with information from the json file. I learned a little bit of JavaScript, how json works and I really like the whole process of making a website because you get fast results.",

It was a great tip from him and I started making Tic Tac Toe. I want to release the app so it had to have a cool feature. A 4x4 board and a 5x5 board. I spend too much time on this feature and when it was done, I came to a conclusion that it was not fun to play on a 4x4 board and a 5x5 board because who begins wins. :( This was painful to see and I learned something very important: PLAY TEST!, I could've just grabbed a piece of paper and test with a friend if this concept was fun to play.
