                    Hi there! I am Sem Pruijs and I love music, art, science and technology.
                    I like making games, playing around with Arduino's and improving my software engineering skills.
                    I am also interested in aerospace engineering and my dream is to go to mars.

                    You will be able to see all my projects here in the future. I am currently working on Flyght.
                    Which is a local multiplayer fly fight game designed for tablets.
                    It will be added someday. You can always visit my GitHub to see some of my projects if you cannot wait.
