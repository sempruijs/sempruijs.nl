        sempruijs.nl is my personal website.
        I made sempruijs.nl in 1 week and the reason i made it is to see all my projects in one place.
        to see my code, my art and my music in one place motivates my to make more and to be more productive.
        Another reason is to release Wosta on another platform: the Web.
        And i came up with a funny name for it: Web + Wosta = Websta!
        Websta is just wosta but it's on sempruijs.nl but Wosta on the App Store will get all the updates and Websta only ones in a while.
        sempruijs.nl is my first website and it's made with html and css. What i really like about web-dev is that you get fast result.
        I also learnt that with webdev, you don't use cammelCase but kebab-case.
        sempruijs.nl is one of the most easiest projects i've ever done and it was fun to make it.

        Wosta is a fish game on IOS where you try to eat fish that are smaller then you.
        For this project i collaborate with Jurriaan Pruijs and Cor Pruijs.
        I worked with Cor Pruijs at the very early stages of the game. He thought with us about overal game design and helped us making decisions for the game.
        I and Jurriaan made the game. We did everything in the Engine and we wrote the code.
        I learnt allot with making Wosta.
        This is the first project were i collaborated with someone who is an experienced programmer.
        He first introduced me to singletons which helped me get organized with the code.
        I made the music in Wosta and the art and the sound effects by myself.
        After release, i made all the updates and the sticker pack.
        Even do collaboration has fade away, it's still our game and i am thankfull for the collaboration with Jurriaan Pruijs and Cor Pruijs.
        Unity cloud build and i dont know how you give a link to make the source code public. If you know how, please contact me.

        aMAZEing is a project to learn unity.
        In didn't have to be big and i also didn't need good game-play.
        It was pure to become familiar with the Unity engine and C#.
        It was fun and a little experimenting. This is where real game development started.
        It was the gate way to Wosta.

<!--Tic Tac Pro section-->

<section class="text">
    <p class="text">
        Tic Tac Pro is tic tac toe made with UIKit and Swift.
        You can play Tic Tac Pro on a 3x3 4x4 or a 5x5 board.
        It was a practice to look if i understood the language.
        I made Tic Tac Pro from scratch to release but i never released it because the 4x4 and the 5x5 game-play were not fun to play.
        I learnt again allot from this project but it's sad to never see it on the app store.
        After tic tac pro, i had the ability to make everything i want with software. It was a gate way to that ability.
        The project was not useless. It was allot of fun and i learnt allot.

<!--Intro to App Development with Swift section-->
<div class="title" id="Intro-to-App-Development-with-Swift-title">Intro to App Development with Swift</div>
<section class="text">
    <p class="text">
        This book was very handy, you make real apps and you can build them to your phone and that's fun.
        SwiftUI came out so all my knowledge that i learnt about UIKit is now useless because SwiftUI is just so much better.
        But ones you know language, you can learn a second one really fast. I learnt allot and i now know how you build a app form Scratch.
        I became through this so much faster with app development that i could make randaam in 1 hour. (no joke)
        I don't think i could make these projects in so short period of time if i didn't read this book.
        I will upload my solutions to github one day.

    <p class="text">
        I took a long pause programming and i thought: I am gonna pick programmming up again and i am going to make it trough.
        This course is amazing and i really recommend it for starting out with programming.
        You have a 3D animated world with a character and you have to get the character from point A to point B through code.
        This is where i really learnt how to program. I will upload my solutions to github one day.

<!--Randaam section-->

<section class="text">
    <h3 class="text">
        Randaam is a dutch random job generator.
        First a read about 6 chapters of the Intro to App Development with Swift book.
        I did not finish it because i wanted to make something and it was hard with the english from a 12 year old.
        I tried to make an app in Xcode with Swift and UIKit and it worked, but the development process did go very slow because of my poor knowledge.
        The most important thing that i learnt is fixing errors and how to google.
        I learned how to wright code, but i had a hard time reading it. Especially with for-loops and arrays.
        I also came first in touch with the terminal, thanks to my brother.
        He really pushed me to use git and that i NEED it.
        I thought he was a little to crazy about git but i'm so happy that he pushed me because now i can look at my old project.
        My projects is save for the rest of my life even when i don't have a computer.
        So thanks to him, you can visit my project on GitHub.
        I'm now busy with bringing a update for randaam that is made with swiftUI so that's why the project looks allot different because it's a "new" project.

<!--Scratch bird game section-->

<section class="text">
    <h3 class="text">
        This is where it started.
        You would be a bird and you try to avoid other birds.
        The most important thing that i learnt is how OSX worked (now macOS)
        I was about at the age of 11 when i made the game and learnt how scratch worked.
        Sadly, i lost the project so i could not see how my code was back in the day.
        Scratch was fun, I learnt allot and it's a easy was to start.
        Through scratch i learnt that coding is a very creative process and that it made you happy.
