<h1 class="Title">About</h1>
    <section class="text text-container" id="About">
<p class="text">
    I'm a 14 year old software developer and i make music and art. What i really like to do is combining my talents with game development.
    I make art with sprites and animation.
    I make music everywhere in the game.
    I also make "The game" Giving rules to the game and make a character move to left and right.
    Combining this is very fun because you get the nerdy thinking and the creative thinking in to one product.
    But i like making software in general, IOS App's, Websites, Games. If you want to know more about what i made you can visit the Projects page.

<h1 class="Title">History</h1>

        <p class="text">
            But game development isn't were it all started.
            My father (Who is a software developer) took me and my sister to a place where people learn you to code. (Mostly with scratch)
            I made a game with scratch and it didn't look like much but i learned how to think as a software developer.
            After that i made Randaam which has it own big story but long story short: Randaam is a dutch job generator made with Swift and UIKit.
            After Randaam i took a pause from coding and made music and art.
            Then i picked coding up again and learned it from scratch with the Swift playground for Ipad swift tutorial.
            I completed pack 1, 2 and 3 and learned allot, i really recommend learning coding this way.
            Then i read the book form Apple: "Intro to App Development with Swift" from the everyone can code series.
            That was the moment where i really began coding being the funnest thing in the world.
            I completed the book and my brother said: If you learned a new language, you have to make tic tac toe to see if you understand it. (He is also a software developer)
            So i did, i called the project: Tic Tac Pro and made it. First the plan was to release it on the App store.
            But why? there are already 1000 tic tac toe games in the app store? Because Tic Tac Pro can be played in 4x4 and 5x5
            A half year of development further seemed that 4x4 and 5x5 game play was not fun and the player that began always won.
            That was really sad, i made music, a app icon, it worked on Iphone and Ipad, it was fully complete for release.
            But i learned ALLOT from tic tac Pro. How constrains work, How to make an app from scratch to release.
            And most importantly: Play test before you spend allot of time in it.
            In this situation i could just grabed a paper and invite a friend a test 5x5 Tic Tac Toe on a paper.
            Sad to see it not go on the App Store but the main purpose was to see if i understand the language. AND I DO! :)
            Tic tac Pro was a gate way to having the ability of making everything you want. So i made a game...
            I did some research and most people recommended unity.
            This game was not for release but to learn how unity works. You program with c# wich is not on the level of swift but is decent.
            I immediately saw that Unity was a good choice, Good documentation, a Good forum and a kind community.
            A made my little game. The game is called: aMAZEing. (you explore a maze)
            I knew the basics of Unity and it was time to make a real game.
            My brother and my father wanted to make a game for a long time and i joined their team and we thought about a game and we came up with Ugh which is later renamed to Wosta.
            That's why you see on the Wosta bottles: Ugh! is the real name.
            We had to change the name because ugh was already taken by someone else on the App Store.
            Now as i'm writing, i'm making sempruijs.nl and i am going to make much more games in the future.
            And that's how i got here, if you want to know more about any project specific, you can look at the project page or e-mail me.
